Work Experiences
Google, Tokyo, Japan
Software Engineer Intern
Jul. 2011 - Sep. 2011
I worked in a project aiming to facilitate people's daily commuting. I significantly optimized the core algorithm used in the back-end and made major contributions to the design and implementation of two front-end Android applications.


Research Projects
Next Generation "Google Directions"
Oct. 2011 - Present
I designed a new direction-query system which takes other users' queries into consideration in order to return more dynamic and accurate lowest-cost routes.


Time-Dependent Shortest Paths
Jan. 2011 - Present
I did scalable implementations of shortest-path algorithms on static and time-dependent graphs, using Combinatorial BLAS Library, a high performance parallel matrix-operation library in development at UCSB and several other organizations. Evaluations showed that the achieved performances were comparable to those observed in Google's Pregel System.


Visibility-based Pursuit-Evasion Problem
Mar. 2011 - May. 2011
I proved a lower bound of the number of robots needed to capture an evader with the same speed in any polygonal environment, possibly with holes.


Business Analytics on Social Networks
Aug. 2010 - Feb. 2011
I optimized an algorithm that clusters people on social networks who make certain purchases. The optimization boosted the performance by 100%.

Cloud Computing
Mar. 2010 - Aug. 2010
I integrated Google App Engine's database backup/restore tool, BulkLoader, to Appscale, an open-source cloud computing platform in development at UCSB.

Graph Mining
Jan. 2010 - Mar. 2010
I improved the famous graph mining algorithm, gSpan, to efficiently mine frequent graph patterns containing wildcard label *.


Quantum Information Processing
Sep .2007 - Jun. 2009
I presented a mathematical framework for quantum teleportation on quantum graph states, which can be used for designing quantum entanglement states to transport quantum information, or for evaluating such capability of a given entanglement.

Sep. 2009  - present
Duties at various times have included office hours and leading weekly discussion sections.

CS 263 Modern Programming Languages and Their Implementations
A graduate level course discussing the key implementation concepts in Java, Python, and C++.

CS 231 Combinatorial Algorithms Topics
A graduate level course discussing advanced combinatorial algorithms.

CS 130B Data Structure and Algorithm II
An upper division course discussing classic algorithms.

CS 40 Fundamental Computer Science
A lower division course about discrete mathematics.
