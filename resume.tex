\section{\sc Work Experiences}
{\bf{Foursquare Labs, Inc.}}\\
{\bf{\em Server Engineer}} \hfill {\bf Jun. 2012 - present}\\
I have been working in the Data Services Team. Daily job includes designing and implementing highly available and scalable data-serving systems. Since joined Foursquare, I have been a main contributor in designing, implementing and maintaining the following services.

1) An SSTable-type low-latency data service that has been widely used internally immidiately after its launch.

2) A read-optimized data service that makes the back-end infrastructure much more available and scalable. While reducing the load on the existing (write) databases, the new service further improves the responsiveness of the read operations to the core data.

I am also working on a side project of analyzing user-generated venue-related text using Map-Reduce.

{\bf{Google}}, Tokyo, Japan\\
{\bf{\em Software Engineer Intern}} \hfill {\bf Jul. 2011 - Sep. 2011}\\
I worked in a research project aiming to facilitate people's daily commute in a metropolitan area. I significantly optimized the back-end algorithm and made major contributions in designing and implementating two front-end Android apps.

{\bf{University of California, Santa Barbara}}\\
{\bf{\em Teaching Assistant}} \hfill {\bf Sep. 2009 - Feb. 2012}\\
Led weekly discussing sessions for undergraduate students in various theoretical CS courses.

\section{\sc Personal\\Project}
{\bf{\em LifeTrack}} \hfill \url{https://github.com/renlijie/LifeTrack}\\
An Android app that automatically generates a ``location diary'' of the user with intelligent power consumption and an intuitive map view.

\section{\sc Research Projects}
\vspace{-.1cm}
{\bf{\em Time-Dependent Shortest Paths in Parallel}}  \hfill {\bf Jan. 2011 - Jun. 2012}\\
I implementated a parallel shortest-path algorithm on static and time-varying graphs. Evaluations showed that we achieved comparable performance to Google's Pregel System (as reported in their paper).

{\bf{\em Visibility-based Pursuit-Evasion Problem}}  \hfill {\bf Mar. 2011 - May. 2011}\\
I proved a lower bound of the number of robots needed to capture an evader with the same speed in any polygonal environment, possibly with holes.

{\bf{\em Business Analytics on Social Networks}}  \hfill {\bf Aug. 2010 - Feb. 2011}\\
I optimized an algorithm used in the paper ``gIceberg'' (see publications) that clusters people on a social network who make certain purchases. The optimization boosted the performance by 100\%.

{\bf{\em Graph Mining}}  \hfill {\bf Jan. 2010 - Mar. 2010}\\
I improved the famous graph mining algorithm, gSpan, to efficiently mine frequent graph patterns that contains wildcard labels.

{\bf{\em Quantum Information Processing}} \hfill {\bf Sep .2007 - Jun. 2009}\\
I presented a mathematical framework for quantum teleportation on quantum graph states, which can be used for designing quantum entanglement states to transport quantum information, or for evaluating such capability of a given entanglement.

\section{\sc More \\About Me}
I am a pianist and an amateur photographer.\\
I love travelling, especially in Japan.\\
I am native in Mandarin, fluent in English, and currently learning Japanese.
